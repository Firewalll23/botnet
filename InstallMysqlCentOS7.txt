This tutorial will help if your server is not letting you install mysql from the source commands. 

if you dont already have wget here is a command to install it: 

yum -y install wget

for this you can wget the mysql version for your server is it is not already centOS 7, if you have centOS 7 then just follow the commands.

wget http://repo.mysql.com/mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm

type ls to see package installed, it sould look like this mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm then copy it.

yum -y install mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm

yum -y install mysql-server

this next part is optional

systemctl start mysqld
systemctl enable mysqld

to check the status of mysqld 

systemctl status mysqld

show databases that you have 

show databases ;
